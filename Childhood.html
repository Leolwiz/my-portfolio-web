        <p>I grew up in a supportive environment where I was taught how to interact with people in a respectful manner
            <br> that shaped my values and character.</p>
        <p>I interacted with family member of my age level where i learnt how to colaborate with others and work<br> with them peacefully and succefully</p>
        <p>This association with age mates also taught me the virtue of kindness and sharing</p>
        <p>My childhood experience also taught me he ability to solve problem</p>
        <p>My childhood experiences taught me discipline, teamwork, and curiosity.</p>
